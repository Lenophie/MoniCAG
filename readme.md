# MoniCAG - Monitor CAG Inventory !

*MoniCAG* is a web application to be used by *Centr'All Games* (*CAG*) to manage its inventory and monitor borrowings.  
*Centr'All Games* is a gaming club from *Ã‰cole Centrale de Lille*. All students from the school can come and play the club's games, or borrow them to play at home.  
Historically, the club was managing its assets and borrowings with paperwork. More recently, the club started using a *Google Form* paired with a *Google Sheet* to declare and track borrowings.  

This application aims at :
* Simplying the borrowing process
* Creating a persistent database for the inventory
* Facilitating the club's annual audit
* Allowing every student from *Centrale Lille* to easily check out the available games
* Preventing bad practices when making borrowings
